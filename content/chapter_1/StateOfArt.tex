\minitoc

The surveillance and control domain is a wide field of research which contains a lot of aspects such as: object tracking, object recognition, 3D mapping and area coverage among others. Our work focused specifically on the latter, i.e. finding a procedure which allows to capture a minimal number of images of a given area maximising its coverage.    
This can be achieved using a set of visual sensors. Many parameters have thus to be taken into account: size and shape of the area itself, field of view of the cameras, number of cameras (or views) to name a few. The following chapter will survey the different methods and techniques proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Keeping in mind that our goal is to find out a technique that works both indoor and outdoor, flexible enough to handle two scenarios: (1) a set of cameras observing simultaneously the area; (2) a single camera moving along a pre-computed path to cover the area. 

\section{Camera positioning }\label{sec:camerasPositioning}

The first step for solving the area coverage problem is the camera positioning, i.e. how to estimate an optimal viewpoint selection to ensure an acceptable coverage. It is known that an efficient camera positioning is a bottleneck in many applications, as for example in the video surveillance field \cite{11*herrera2012,12*soto2009,18*ding2012,151*zhao2013,84*xu2011}, where an efficient camera positioning is essential to monitor correctly an area.  
The following section will deal with the question of: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]What is a good position and orientation for a camera (i.e. a good camera pose)?
\item[-]What are the purposes of the application requiring camera positioning?

\end{itemize}
These questions have already been investigated and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. 


\subsection{Efficient pose in a camera network: challenges and objectives}
The first point to address is defining the pose of the camera (or set of cameras). In computer vision, the pose of a camera is composed of its position in space and orientation (or looking direction), i.e. of 3 translations and 3 rotations in a world coordinate frame. The second point to be addressed is how to define a "good" or "optimal" camera pose(s)?\\
 To do so, it is essential to identify the purposes, tasks and priorities of the application: 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item [-] what is the final goal?
 \item [-] what are the important features for the application (e.g. to track an object, to have a high-resolution mapping, etc.)?
 \item [-] what are the shooting conditions and physical constraints?
 \end{itemize}
   All of these aspects will have an incidence on the definition and formalization of a "good camera poses". For instance, in \cite{22*zhao2008}, the purpose is to detect tags placed on people torso which forces the camera to be positioned at a certain height with a looking direction almost parallel to the ground; on the contrary, in \cite{146*li2011}, a camera is mounted on a UAV to monitor a vast outdoor area, which forces it to have a looking direction almost perpendicular to the ground. 

%It is important to do not confuse the finality and the objectives. For example video surveillance is the finality but the coverage of an area or the target tracking, it is required to have an efficient surveillance. The coverage is one of the objectives the most interesting and the most common about cameras positioning.
% !!!!!!!!!
%  The objectives are different from the finality. The objectives are the most important elements to take in consideration in order to place the set of cameras. When the finality is the global application, as for example video surveillance is the finality but the coverage of an area, the target tracking is required to have an efficient surveillance. The coverage is one of the objectives the most interesting and the most common about cameras positioning.
%!!!!!!!!!
%The coverage can be applied on cover each side of an object (as  in [142*]). But in most of the case the coverage is applied on area ( inside or outside). 

%To have a clever and efficient cameras positioning system different aspects must be studied. First, to pose efficiently a set of cameras it is useful to know what does it mean efficient for the camera pose. To do that the objective of the cameras network have to be defined clearly. 

%The objectives  vary and depending than the finality the cameras position is greatly affected.
These two articles share the same objective, i.e. to get the best possible coverage of an area, but since the constraints and secondary objectives they must comply with are different (e.g. number of cameras, resolution, luminosity, tracking, etc.), it leads to different formulation and approach. 

The next section focuses on positioning the camera to maximize viewing areas. The viewing area or coverage rate of the area is directly related to the estimated position of each camera and their orientation. To get the best coverage, it is essential to find the best pose for each camera, depending on the constraints and possible secondary goals.\\
%(!!!! The finality and thus the secondary objective greatly, have an important influence on the camera positioning.!!!!!)

Camera positioning for maximizing the coverage rate has been studied these past decades, using many different approaches. The following sub-section will provide an overview of different ways of defining the coverage drawn from the literature.

%The approaches was greatly influenced by finality. In fact the finality will involve a main objective and potential some other secondary objective with their constraint. In many case the coverage maximization is the main objective but the impact of the secondary objectives are not negligible. In numerous cases, the maximization of the coverage is only the first part of the problem, hence the importance of secondary objectives.
%The following sections are dedicated on what kind of area is covered  what is exactly the coverage with the secondary objectives  associated too.
%%Indeed to maximize the coverage rate by optimizing the cameras position has been studied this past decade, using many different approaches. \\
%%His approach is applicable depending on the formulation of the constraints and objectives. In numerous cases, the maximization of the coverage is only the first part of the problem, hence the importance of secondary objectives.\\
%%The following part is focused on what kind of area is covered what is exactly called coverage and with the secondary objectives associated too.

\subsection{Objective: Coverage }\label{sec:FirstObjCover}

Before formalising the coverage rate to be maximised, it is necessary to define exactly what is meant by coverage: is the aim to maximise the surface area of a three-dimensional object or a 2D zone whose perimeter has been circumscribed? Is there a priori knowledge of the area to be covered (its perimeter, its bounding box, etc.) or not? Is the area to be covered homogeneous or does it contain prioritized sub-areas? 
% Among the huge possible definition more or less restrictive the more interesting to studied is discussed: 


\begin{itemize}
%-------------------------------------------------
\item Object coverage: \\
\begin{figure}[t!]
\center
\minipage{0.75\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/objectCoverFrom142.png}
  \caption{Full coverage of an object in the 3D space. The coverage is made by selecting a set of adapted waypoints. the coverage must be good enough to can reconstruct the 3D shape of the object without any occlusion. This result is from Hoppe et al. \cite{142*hoppe2012}.}\label{fig:ObjectCover142}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}
   %The definition of a coverage can be varied this is a good example. 
   In Hoppe et al. \cite{142*hoppe2012} a good coverage is defined by the ability to have full 3D reconstruction of an object (in their 3 dimensions) with no occlusion. In this work, some prior knowledge on the object is exploited such as a rough surface description (mesh). The camera follows a trajectory "around" the object and its looking direction is oriented towards the center of the mesh (see Figure \ref{fig:ObjectCover142}). 
  Since it is a matter of covering the 3D surface of an object, in a next-best-view strategy, this application remains too far from the one we wish to implement.  It is therefore barely applicable to our problem. \\ 
   %-------------------------------------------------
   \item Path to cover: \\
   \begin{figure}[t!]
\center
\minipage{0.75\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/PathToCover[81].png}
  \caption{The path to cover is illustrate in the work of Nikolaidis et al. \cite{81*nikolaidis2009}. The aim is to is focused on cover a road (walk path) in a small room by using 3 cameras. }\label{fig:pathToCover81}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}
   The point here is to observe the entire trajectory commonly taken by users (car, pedestrian, …). When the area to cover is a well-known place, the main trajectory taken by the users can be estimated or extracted \cite{27*bodor2005}. If the area to cover is a road, for instance, then the trajectory of the driver is known \cite{14*lu2011}. In this condition, the aim is to cover the common trajectory of the user as presented in  \cite{14*lu2011,27*bodor2005,30*bodor2005,81*nikolaidis2009} (see the Figure \ref{fig:pathToCover81}). The path coverage is interesting due to the restricted area to cover: not an entire area, but only a path within a given area, that can be seen as a priority sub-area. \\
   %-------------------------------------------------
   \item Coverage priority: \\
      \begin{figure}[t!]
\center
\minipage{0.75\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/MapRoI165.png}
  \caption{Map of an area to cover with crucial sub-area (region of interest) the normal sub-area  and obstacle. This map is an example of area coverage  introduce in  Jiang et al. \cite{165*jiang2010}. }\label{fig:MapRoI165}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}
   A natural way of defining the coverage in a context of insufficient number of cameras, is to define as priority.
    In \cite{84*xu2011,165*jiang2010,171*horster2006}, some predefined regions are set as "priority" and called respectively "region of interest", "crucial sub-area" (see Figure \ref{fig:MapRoI165}) and "importance space weighting".  In the solutions proposed  by \cite{84*xu2011,165*jiang2010,171*horster2006}, the camera poses are in priority affected to this specific and restricted region which has the effect to neglect the other parts of the area. \\
If the environment is composed of some regions of interest, there should be also "normal" sub-areas. These "normal sub-areas" should be covered, but with lower priority. Furthermore, some  sub-areas can be defined as "no interest", which mean "not to be covered". In \cite{165*jiang2010,171*horster2006} for example, the obstacles are defined as "no interest" regions with also the consequence to  be occluding area. The idea is to keep a maximum of freedom in the camera network positioning and allow the system to handle local priority and constraints.\\
%-------------------------------------------------
\item Inside or outside area:\\ 
Another important feature to define the coverage is related to indoor/outdoor scenes. The area to cover can be typically a room with walls (indoor). Each wall must be a considered as an obstacle occluding the camera field of view,  which results in having to manage the visibility of the environment according to these obstacles and to the position of the cameras. For outdoor scenes, it is often necessary to take into account the size of the environment according to the reduced field of view of the camera. This has the effect of increasing the number of required cameras (or views) and leveraging the combinatory. 

%(also in the inside area the constraint must be the restricted posibel position of the camera (the camera must be placed on the wall for exemple))
   
\end{itemize}
  

The common points in all the examples discussed is the aim of maximizing the coverage rate. The positioning of the cameras, and its effects on the coverage rate, is thus constrained by the application itself, the context  and the type of observed scenes.\\
%!!!!!!
%The common points in all this coverage definition is the importance to maximize it, despite the other objectives. In the examples presented the coverage was always the first and for some of them the only objective. Despite the interest for maximizing the coverage some other elements has to be taken in account to have a useful cameras position depending on the finality. 
Of course, additional constraints can have also a significant impact on the camera pose. Some of the more common constraints found in the literature are listed below:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item  The numbers of cameras: \\ In many cases,  the number of cameras used for the coverage should be minimised such as in  \cite{151*zhao2013,171*horster2006,22*zhao2008}. Limiting the number of cameras is primordial to decrease the computation time and the bandwidth. It also reduces the cost of the setup \cite{82*chrysostomou2012}. Reducing the number of cameras and optimising their poses to get an optimal coverage are closely related tasks, not necessarily competing. Too few cameras can shrink the coverage rate by leaving black-holes in some areas of the scene. Too many cameras can result in too much overlap and unnecessary redundancy.\\

\item Object tracking: \\
\begin{mfigures}[!]{Illustration of an covered area for tracking target. Experiment  form Ding et al. \citep{18*ding2012} }{fig:Tracking18} \centering
\mfigure{width=.65\linewidth}{img/coverageTrackingDing[18]a.png}{Initial coverage for 5 cameras dedicated to detect the  input of target.}{subfig:taget18a}
\hspace{1cm} \\
\mfigure{width=.65\linewidth}{img/coverageTrackingDing[18]b.png}{The covered area when the objective have to track several target.}{subfig:taget18b}
\end{mfigures}	
 Constraints can arise by the objective of detecting and localising a given target \cite{18*ding2012,12*soto2009,23*liu2009,39*wu2011,40*sohrabi2000,22*zhao2008}. In such a case, camera poses must be estimated in order to track one or more targets, and possibly, dynamically adapted. These applications very often require an adaptation of the camera orientation (looking direction) more than its position. This is the reason why they actually use PTZ cameras (Pan, Tilt and Zoom) as in \cite{18*ding2012,38*liu2010,12*soto2009} (see Figure \citep{18*ding2012}).
Keeping a full area covered and at the same time tracking efficiently one or more targets can be contradictory. The solution is then the result of a trade-off between coverage and tracking, as in \cite{18*ding2012} and \cite{38*liu2010}.
 In Liu et al. \cite{38*liu2010} target tracking in a wide area is decomposed in two steps: detection and localisation. Each of these steps is done independently on each camera. Area coverage is essential to detect the targets, less for localisation as the priority is, in this step, to track a target previously detected within the covered area. In the entire camera network used, one camera may be in detection mode while another is in location mode. Obviously, by adding target tracking as a constraint, camera poses and coverage are usually less efficient because of the subset of cameras assigned to the tracking.  \\

\item  Luminosity and environmental setup:\\ Intrinsic image quality is also a constraint that can guide area coverage. The quality of an image can result in sufficient brightness or an almost uniformly distributed histogram, etc. In other words, the captured images must be such that they guarantee a usable signal. For example, Reddy et al. \cite{33*reddy2012} addressed first the coverage problem of a complex area and in second time,  target localization. In order to decide which target must be tracked, the quality of the image is taking into account to avoid dark areas where the target is hardly detectable. In this case, the tracking and coverage trade-off discussed in the previous paragraph is  ruled by the image quality. \\

\item  Energetic cost:
\\ Authors suggest to estimate camera positioning or path planning by minimizing a cost function that represents the energy consumption, such as in  \cite{38*liu2010,42*bulusu2001}. For instance, in Lui et al. \cite{38*liu2010}, the  objective is to cover most of an area to detect whether a target is entered in or not. In a second time, the target is tracked by smart and autonomous cameras of the network. The set of cameras are randomly distributed in the area and the coverage problem is, in this case, to select the best cameras in order to detect the target. The selection of the cameras is estimated by both maximizing the area coverage and minimizing the energy consumption. The consumption can be obviously reduced by restricting the number of cameras set in detection mode. Indeed, the cameras are more or less power-consuming depending on the activated mode (which can be "detection", "tracking" or "sleepy"). If we consider now path planning, the energy cost can be represented by the distance between two cameras or views and energy minimization is equivalent to finding the shortest path \cite{191*di2016,218*meiting2007}.  
\\
\item Multi coverage:\\
 Among the numerous possible constraints, the multi-coverage is interesting (as for example in \cite{149*mavrinac2013,151*zhao2013,152*wang2009,174*zhang2016,175*medhi2013}). It can be seen as a coverage problem where one or a few specific sub-areas must be covered by a minimum of $k$ cameras at the  same time, that's why it is also called $k$-coverage. Multi-coverage does not necessarily mean priority: a sub-area which is to be covered by several cameras is not necessarily a sub-area which must be covered in priority (more details in Section \ref{sec:zoneOfInterest}). However, mobilizing multiple cameras in a given sub-area means that fewer cameras can be used to cover the rest of the area, which can be compensated by adding cameras, if allowed. On the contrary full-coverage of the area and k-coverage of some sub-areas will conflict and lead to a trade-off. 
 %This secondary objective in the case of limit will generate a conflict between the full coverage of the area and the $k$-coverage requirement even more with a restricted number of cameras. 
\\ 
\item  Resolution:\\ In order to keep or increase the quality of the captured images, a minimum resolution threshold or value can be fixed and used as a constraint \cite{27*bodor2005,33*reddy2012,171*horster2006,152*wang2009,43*erdem2006}. The focal length, the size of the pixel grid or the camera-target distance can served as a measure for the resolution. However, in many applications, it is easier to adapt the distance than to change the focal length (which can be fixed or affect the calibration) or, of course, to change the size of the pixel grid. In most of the cited works, the distance from the target to the camera along the optical axis is therefore used as a measure for the resolution.\\
%The resolution is also model as the acceptable the depth of field.
Full coverage will tend to move the cameras at the farther distance (or higher elevation) in order to maximise the field of view. Resolution constraint will impose the cameras to be positioned in a certain range of distance or elevation. Full coverage and resolution constraint will lead to a trade-off between guaranteeing most of the area to be covered and a sufficient image resolution. The trade-off is particularly beneficial when the number of cameras is more important than the optimal need, in this case, the distance will be reduced and the resolution mechanically increased. \\
   In \cite{33*reddy2012} the problem has been formalized by using a Gaussian function in order to define the proper distance between the cameras and the target to keep an acceptable resolution for the application. \\
Here, the depth of view is used to define the range of distances. The focus point and the aperture of the camera will define the optimal distance and range in which the target is optimally focused \cite{193*fu2014}. Constraining the positioning with the depth of view can be seen somehow as a constraint on the resolution itself. 

\end{itemize}

The constraints are numerous and varied, we just introduced a few of them which seems interesting to us and related to our work. Among them, some are closely related and can be interconnected, they can even be combined as in \cite{33*reddy2012}, where the targets coverage, luminosity, resolution, are all associated to find the best camera positions maximizing the area coverage and the tracking target with good visibility condition. \\
One interesting point to study is the impact of these constraints on the full coverage itself as we have seen that they introduce a trade-off between their own particular goal and the main goal of area coverage but also between themselves. No need to say thus, that the constraints have to be chosen carefully and accordingly weighted as in any multi-objective problems. 


\subsection{Art gallery problem} \label{sec:AGP}
%Once the objectives defined the next step, is to know how to represent the problems. To do that manly 2 different class  of problems have to be studied. The first is from the geometrical problem called  the Art galery problms.

%The previous section was focus on the objectives definition as well as the finality around the sensors and cameras position

%Until now the problem was presented in term of objectives and constraint in order to be used in a concrete situation.

The Art Gallery Problem (AGP) is a theoretical and historical problem closely related to the camera positioning. The AGP is commonly cited  in the literature as a source of the problem of camera positioning (for full coverage). It is also commonly used to estimate the complexity of the task (notably due to the room shape) and  as starting point to find an appropriate answer. 
The problem of cameras positioning can be formulate as the AGP paradigm (as example \citep{44*chvatal1975,53*packer2008,149*mavrinac2013}). For these reasons the AGP as to be well understood before to go further.

%Until now the problem of coverage was studied to place cameras. The use of cameras (fix or mounted on mobile robot) are the limited field of view  and  depth field of the sensor. An interesting paradigm closely related is to use human guards  instead  of the set of cameras.  This paradigm is called the Art Gallery Problem (AGP). The AGP is an interesting  paradigm with propose some efficient solution. 

In the following sections a definition of the AGP is given with a brief history. After a more general introduction to AGP, we will describe some interesting solutions found in the literature and discuss their limitations.

%The problem of camera positioning is a tricky problem. The positioning of the set of cameras depend on many factor. To solve this problems is importatant to know more about the relat
% %finality of the camera networks and the formulation the camera pose will be affected.\\
%% Once the objectives defined ( see section \ref{sec:camerasPositioning}) the next step, is to know how to represent the problems. To do that manly 2 different paradigms have to be studied.
% The first is from the geometrical problem called the Art Gallery Problem (AGP) formulation is commonly and historically borrowed as is presents in the following section with a fast definition of the problems, the solution used and the limit of this paradigm.


	\subsubsection{Definition of the paradigm} \label{sec:AGPdef}
	\begin{figure}[t!]
\center
\minipage{0.65\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/AGP3.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the AGP. The gallery is cover by  4 guard ($x_1;...;x_4$) for a polygon  composed by $n$ vertice ($v_1;...;v_n$).}\label{fig:AGP}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}
	The art gallery problem is a geometrical problem introduced by Victor Klee in 1973. The problem was to estimate the number and the position of useful guards to cover an art gallery. 
The particularity of a art gallery is the complexity of the room shape, with many walls to place the paintings. The shape complexity of the room make the estimation of guards number even more difficult.\\
In order to formulate properly the problem, the room is assimilated as a polygon $P$, composed by $n$ vertices ($v_1; v_2;…v_n$). The vertices are linked by $n$ edges ($v_1 v_2;…; v_{n-1} v_n$) to make the shape of the Polygon $P$ (or room).

A guard $x$ is inside the room $x \in P$. A guard $x$ can cover or see any point $y \in P$ if the segment $xy$ is not intersect by one of boundary (a wall) of the polygon $P$, in order to have $ xy \subseteq P$.
The polygon $P$ is considered as fully covered when for any position of the point $y$ in the polygon, at least one guard can see it .\\
A guard $x$ can have a $360^\circ$ field of view to cover all around him, with no depth of field limitation (except the walls obstacle). Clearly that means the guard can see and monitor the entire room from one side to the other side if no obstacles around to occlude. For example, if the shape of the room is a triangle, quadrilateral or another convex simple polygon, at any position taken by one guard, this guard can monitor all the area despite the size of the art gallery (see Figure \ref{fig:AGP}). 

When the polygon is more complex, it is necessary to estimate the minimum number $g$ of guards $x$ and the position of the guards in polygon $P$. 
 The set of minimum number of guards are listed in $X$. Where $X$ contains the useful $x$ to fully cover the polygons $P$, with $g$ the minimums number of guard in order to have a set of points $X=\{x_1…x_i…. x_g\}$. So that every point $y$ in $P$  are cover by at least on guard $x$ of the set of $X$. \\
The AGP in addition to estimating the numbers of guards,  is also interested in finding the optimal position of this restricted number of guards. 
These two questions can be solved at the same time by using one of the solutions proposed.


	\subsubsection{Solution }
	
	The advances on the AGP since its formulation in 1973 are numerous. The following paragraphs present some of the main proposals and contributions..\\
	 The first and one of the more important is the proof given by Chvàtal in 1975 \cite{44*chvatal1975}.  The proposed polygon must have to be covered by a minimum of guards, the proof of Chvàtal propose to link the minimum number of guards $g$ to the number of vertices $n$. 
A polygon composed by $n$ vertices need in the worst case a minimum number of guards equal at $n/3$. The Chvàtal proof is based on the triangulation of the polygon. The triangulation is made based on the vertices of the polygon.\\
	 % For a polygon composed by $n$ vertices in the worst case the minimum guard necessary to cover it, is $X=n/3$.
	     The proof given by Chvàtal is also confirmed by the work of Fisk  few years later (1978). The work of Fisk is also based on triangulation and colouring node. It is probably the easiest way to understand and also give a solution to estimate the pose of each guard. It is recommended to begin by the Fisk proof before the Chvàtal one, despite the chronology order as it is recommended in \cite{219*orourke1987}. The book of O'Rourke et al. \cite{219*orourke1987} is an early work about the AGP with the formulation, proofs and advancement of the field clearly explained. \\
After the important work of Chvàtal which allow to can estimate the minimum number of guards in the worst case and consequently fix a limit to the AGP. Thus, the research has been oriented toward the optimal guard positioning. The goal is to find the best algorithms to solve the AGP for all kind of polygon while reducing the complexity in time (reducing the $O(...)$).\\
%Once the proof of the minimum number in the worst case founded the objective became to find an optimal guard position for all kind of polygon in reasonable time. \\
For that the work of Toussaint and Avis (in 1981) is the reference and propose a solution working in $O(n log n)$. This work has been follow and upgrade until the solution of Couto, Resend and Souza  2011 \cite{224*couto2011}. The solution  finally proposed work in $O(n^3)$ complexity in the worst case. 

%It is a short overview of the AGP solution but also the solution proposed are very specific to the AGP and cannot be re-use for problem little different.

	
	\subsubsection{Limit of AGP and camera coverage relation}

The AGP can be considered as a reduction of the best cameras pose estimation to maximize the coverage of a complex area. Based on the algorithms developed to solve the AGP and the strong relation between AGP and the cameras positioning (for maximum coverage problem), it is logic to have some proposed algorithms which tries to extend the AGP to the  problem of camera positioning as example in \cite{221*fleishman2000,33*reddy2012,43*erdem2006}.\\
%The problem of positioning cameras for maximum coverage is quite close then the AGP. The AGP is a reduction of the camera positioning for a total coverage of a complex areas. The camera positioning is the logical continuation of AGP and once the AGP is solved , the problem can be extended as is for example show in \cite{221*fleishman2000,33*reddy2012,43*erdem2006}.
The algorithm developed for AGP cannot be applied directly on the problem of cameras positioning for maximum coverage. The main reasons are the cameras limitations as field of view and depth of field (see \cite{82*chrysostomou2012,170*yabuta2008}). The cameras limitation makes  unreadable the algorithm proposed to solve the AGP.
 Because the AGP considering the guard with no limitations for the depth of field and field of view. Due to these differences the geometric model of AGP may not be applicable for perspective cameras.
Also another reason make the AGP solution not applicable for the camera positioning can be the diversity of cameras in the same system (as cameras perspective with different focal length or associate to non perspective cameras as omnidirectional camera).
 The AGP may have many guards, they are all interchangeable. The interchangeability is due to the guards ability (or skill) to monitor the area. In contrary it is possible to have for a camera network different kind of cameras with different lenses. 
Finally the  perfect assumption for the AGP formulation create important weakness when is time to replace the guards by cameras. These weaknesses make the algorithms form AGP not adapted in our problem, as is showed in \cite{81*nikolaidis2009,171*horster2006}.
%This weakness in the AGP formulation associate to the limited field of view  make the solution form AGP note adapted as  is showed in \cite{81*nikolaidis2009,171*horster2006}.\\Due to this limitation, the solution developed for AGP are not applicable. 

However, some part of the AGP formulation and especially some proofs are still importance, as the proof of Chvàtal \cite{44*chvatal1975} or the NP-hard complexity proof. 
In fact, the AGP is proof as a NP-hard problems, the proof is available on the book of O’Rourke section 9.2 of the book \cite{219*orourke1987}.  The NP-hard mean the problem cannot be solved in a deterministically way in a reasonable time. 
In order to proof the AGP is  NP-hard, the first part is to reduce the  problem to an other problem well known for this complexity. The relation is made by reducing the AGP with a polygon composed by  holes to another standard proble,in the demonstration the 3SAT is used to be exact. 
The 3SAT is a restriction of the SAT problem with atleast 3 literal in each clause (example of  1 clause wiht 3 literal $(x\lor \neg y \land z)$) , The SAT as to satisfy a boolean expression (written with only AND $\land$, OR $\lor$, NOT $\neg$) by assigning the appropriate value to the variable of the boolean expression (True and False).\\
Once the AGP is reduced to 3SAT (see \citep{227*tovey1984}) and because 3SAT is an NP-complete problem the AGP is  also considered as NP-complete or  NP-hard but only  when the room is composed with holes. Also another work of Lee and Lin 1986 proofed the complexity of AGP without hole also by reducing the AGP on another well known problem (for more explication see the book of O’Rourke  section 9.3 \cite{219*orourke1987}).
Despite the limit of AGP, numerous articles are based on the AGP to formulate the problem as in \cite{43*erdem2006,53*packer2008}. For example in \cite{43*erdem2006} a similar approach to AGP is used in order to estimate the occluded regions. 
As explained earlier the cameras positioning can be reduced as an AGP \cite{53*packer2008} notably by removing most of the constraints due to the camera properties (as depth of field and field of views). 

In the literature numerous articles use the AGP as reference to explain the complexity of the problem of camera positioning as for example \cite{26*moeini,44*chvatal1975,149*mavrinac2013,151*zhao2013}. The problem of camera positioning for maximum coverage is at least NP-hard or NP-complete. 
The complexity of the problem will have an impact on the solution used  to try to solve it and optimize it.\\
One other impact of AGP in the problem of camera positioning is the shape of the rooms. In \cite{170*yabuta2008,171*horster2006,33*reddy2012,43*erdem2006} the shape of the room to cover are similar then the definition of an art gallery (in AGP). The art gallery room is a complex polygon composed by many vertices which may occlude the view (as explain in Section \ref{sec:AGPdef} and like in the Figure \ref{fig:AGP}). This phenomena can be imputed to the link did between the number of vertices and the useful number of guards to cover it. 
In addition the occlusion formulation made for the AGP is commonly used.
The occlusion in AGP is defined  by  a segment $xy \not\subset P$   where $x \in P$ is the guard position $y \in P$ is a points in the room $P$. 
Moreover the use of a complex room inspired by AGP is therefore a good choice in order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms developed for the cameras positioning in a complex environment.
%The complexity of this problem is also an important factor which makes the relation of camera positioning and AGP. \\


The AGP can be at same time for part, the  historical source of the cameras positioning and give a beginning of an answer about the problem, this formulation and this complexity. Despite that, the AGP is not the only source to refer about the cameras positioning for maximize the coverage. Some clue and algorithms can be found in other related fields. 


\subsection{Wireless sensor network }\label{sec:WSNstateOfArt}

The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can be as AGP considered an inspiration for the problem of cameras positioning to maximize the coverage. The WSN is an active field of research related in many aspects to camera positioning. These sections are focused on the WSN and this relation with the cameras positioning.\\  To begin:

\textbf{What is the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)? }

 The WSN is a distributed network of sensors or in some cases actuators, is also called WSAN (Wireless Sensors and Actuators Network). Each sensor of the network acts as a relay for the information to the rest of the network.  
The sensors are at the same time the nodes and the relay for the network. The node has the purpose to transmit the information to the other node. 
The information can be centralized or not :
\begin{itemize}
\item When the system is centralized the information has to be transmitted node by node until the centralized agent. The computation and the decision about the network is taken by this centralized agent before to be transmitted back to the node. 
\item Otherwise the node have to be the sensors to collect informations and decide to communicate with the others nodes depending on the situation (example when the target is detected in their field). The nodes have to manage alone or with this neighbourhood the informations and computation before to react in consequences. 

\end{itemize}
 
The information collected by the sensors are vast depending on the final application and the capacities of the sensors ability. 
The WSN is used in different field for various applications as for Telecom with antenna positioning \cite{59*wang2008}, military surveillance field \cite{38*liu2010,101*topcuoglu2009}, airport surveillance \cite{37*ma2012}, video surveillance and tracking \cite{38*liu2010}, environmental monitoring \cite{42*bulusu2001}... 
Logically the sensors can collect numerous type of informations depending the need as temperature, movements, images, song and also some  actuator can be used as radio frequency for example.\\
 The application of WSN are wide, especially since the WSN can be useful in many application field. The WSN try to optimize a network of sensors in different aspects as for example \cite{39*wu2011} focus on an adapted architecture efficient enough for data transfer (here the data are images) or like in \cite{40*sohrabi2000} the WSN are dedicate to adapt the network around static nodes and energetic resources in order to keep the network connected.  \\
For our case the aspect the more interesting of the WSN, is the coverage of an area with his constraints.
 The other discipline of the WSN as the network optimisation will not be addressed in the following document. Only the problem of coverage is studied the other discipline are not considered as the first or main objective but can be some secondary objectives after the problem of coverage which has to be taking in account for the optimization. 

\subsubsection{Sensor at 360}

\minipage{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/WsnSensor1.png}
  \caption{One omnidirectional sensor centred on $x$, with a radius $r$ for the range.}\label{fig:WsnSensor1}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}

	

The WSN refer commonly to sensors or actuators  with no restriction in the view angle, it is considered to have a $360^\circ$ field of view. The sensor field of view can be represented in a 2D plan  as in \cite{200*kulkarni2011, 174*zhang2016,150*chakrabarty2002} (as illustrate in the Figure \ref{fig:WsnSensor1}) and in some case a spherical for the 3D environment example in \cite{175*medhi2013,59*wang2008}.  \\
Each sensor have a position $x$ in the area and a power range. From the sensor power  the radius $r$ of the circle is deduced from $x$ as center (see Figure \ref{fig:WsnSensor1}). This circle give the area cover by a sensor in the simplest case. 
The simplest case correspond to a flat area without any obstacle as in \cite{200*kulkarni2011,174*zhang2016} (see the Figure \ref{fig:WsnSensorNet}).  
Others more complex solutions can be used. A more complex solution but also more realistic as in Wang et al. \cite{59*wang2008}. Where are taking in account the relief and obstacles. 
In Zhang et al. \cite{174*zhang2016} more complex model has been developed, where despite of a flat ground without obstacle each sensor is represented by a perception radius and a communication radius. The communication radius a bit bigger than the perception radius. These two radius with the same center correspond, first to area covered for one antenna (sensors for the perception) and the second radius to the distance of emission/reception of the data (actuators for the transition).  In order to have an efficient coverage of the area, the antennas must be place in order to have connection with other antenna but without too much overlap of the perception sensor.\\

The solution proposed in order to optimize the positioning of the WSN for a circular sensors can be varied. Mostly two different ways are applied for the sensor which have circular angle of view or spherical.\\

\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}


\item	The first solution use a heuristic based on geometry construction as in  Medhi et al. \cite{175*medhi2013}. This approach gives a good coverage solution but is usually greedy and can be quickly limited due to an important number of sensors required, moreover if some external constraints are added.  For example in Zhang et al. \cite{174*zhang2016} the greedy solution was tested and optimized by using a "partition and shifting" strategy in order to upgrade the result.
The limit of this solution,  is this greedy consumption resources and it is not applicable to the problem of cameras positioning due to the reduced field of views of a cameras.  \\
\item	The second solution, intends to find an efficient and quick solution to optimize initial randomly position, for each sensor of the network.  
This solution includes many different families of algorithms focused on optimization.
Among the family of algorithms, the evolutionary algorithms (disused in detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:EA}) is commonly used as in \cite{200*kulkarni2011,59*wang2008}, and \cite{150*chakrabarty2002}. \\
These solutions propose to optimize the position in order to maximize the coverage depending on constraints. The method of optimization have to be adapted to the problem. 
In Chakrabarty et al. \cite{150*chakrabarty2002} the integer linear programming  is chosen in order to maximize the coverage with two types of sensors. One standard with a smaller area coverage but with a smaller cost (can have a $100m$ radius for 150\$) and the other sensors can cover a wider region (can have a $200m$  radius for 200\$) and the objective is to cover the region while reducing the financial cost. The solution proposed is to use the integer linear programming adapted to the problem of coverage optimization with the financial cost as constraint. \\
In \cite{59*wang2008} and \cite{200*kulkarni2011} the solution proposed is based on two different evolutionary algorithms in order to optimize the sensors positioning. 
In Kulkarni et al. \cite{200*kulkarni2011} the camera positioning with a multi coverage is solved by using an evolutionary algorithm called Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO). The objective is to optimize the position of the sensor in order to have an efficient coverage of the area and also enough redundancy to keep the network workable if one or few sensors fail. In Wang et al. \cite{59*wang2008} one evolutionary algorithms is also used to optimize the position of antennas. The objectives in this paper is to give the best coverage of an area with taking in count the relief of the area. The relief make the coverage estimation of each sensor even more complex and costly in terms of time computation. The genetic algorithm is used in order to find quickly a position for each antenna of the network. 
\end{itemize}

Among the solution proposed, the second, based on optimize a set of sensors position  depending then  the constraints, is the more interesting and the more flexible to the add of new additional constraints (and secondary objectives). \\
The following sections is dedicated to see if these solutions is applicable to the problem of positioning a set of cameras. Despite the camera constraints.
%The aim is to see up to what point and if it is applicable to the problem of cameras network positioning.  

	\subsubsection{Visual sensors}
	
	\begin{figure}[t!]
	\center
\minipage{0.65\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/coverage[165].png}
  \caption{Illustration of  the  area coverage with visual sensors. The area  is cover at 47\%. Experiment form Jiang et al. \citep{165*jiang2010} }\label{fig:Coverage165}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}
	
Logically, the result obtained with the Omni-directional sensors are interesting. These results must be applied to the problem with even more constraints and objectives for the positioning of Visual Sensor Network (VSN). The term of  visual sensor contains several types of cameras with several constraints and properties. Despite these several types of cameras, the more commonly used and studied is the perspective camera (as in \citep{149*mavrinac2013,174*zhang2016,193*fu2014,42*bulusu2001,165*jiang2010})(see Figure \ref{fig:Coverage165}). 
  In fact the visual sensor or camera have a limited depth of field but also a limited field of view. This new constraints makes the cameras positioning more complex, as that was for AGP (see Section \ref{sec:AGP}) to passes from guard to camera.
 The advantage in this case, is first the sensor has been designed with a limited depth of field (the sensor has a limited power range). 
 Moreover the solution applied previously for circular sensor was not only geometric or based on heuristic algorithms. The problem has also been formalized as an optimization problem. These problem formulations allow to use optimization algorithms and meta-heuristics. In addition, these problem formulations appear as the more suitable to add constraints and secondary objectives. Thanks to that, the solutions developed for the WSN can mostly be adapted to the problem of cameras positioning. 
 The following sections as to aims to disuse about the algorithms applied until now to the problem of camera positioning.
 %but also the problem is formalized as optimization problems with some solutions based on optimization and meta-heuristic. This way to present the problem is appear as the more suitable to add constraint and secondary objectives. Also the solution and the formulation for the problem of VSN are mostly the same then the problems of cameras positioning and is discussed in the following parts  \\
  

	\section{Solution not based on evolutionary method}\label{sec:NonEAmethod}
	
The algorithms used to pose a set of cameras in order to maximize the coverage are various.  Among the possible algorithms manly two families can be describe. The algorithms proposed they come from numerous sources and paradigm  which AGP and WSN.\\
 The first family is to construct a solution using a heuristic to have an appropriated cameras position. The second way is to formalize the problem as optimization problem and applied meta-heuristics. 

\subsection{The constructive solution}

The cameras pose can be done by construction. By construction that mean a deterministic method is applied to pose iteratively one camera after another or to adjust their positions based an initial set-up.\\
In Liu et al. \cite{38*liu2010} a constructive solution is applied in order to select the smart cameras of the network. Each smart camera, are a node of the network to transmit informations and images. The smart cameras are fully autonomous in term of energies and decision-making ability (no central master). 
The nodes can be  in 3 different types of mode:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Sleepy mode. The sleepy mode is used in order to economize a maximum of the energy. To do that the camera is turn off. That mean no computation and just the network is listen at regular intervals to wait the wakeup call.   \\

\item[-] Detection mode. The detection mode the camera is turn on, but with a low frame rate. Just a few computations are done to detect if a target is enter in the field of views. Some information may be transmit by network. This mode consume more energy of the previews but the smart cameras can stay in this mode during a long time.\\

\item[-] Tracking mode. This mode is the more active, thus energy consumer. The camera is turn on, with a high frame rate and numerous computation has been done to track and localize the targets. Also more informations have to be transmit by the network. The informations are useful to localize the targets by communicate with the potential other smart cameras with may have a view on the targets. 
\end{itemize}
The objective in \cite{38*liu2010} are multiples, depending on the state of the cameras. The one the more interesting for us is to keep under control the longest time as possible the area for target detection. Numerous smart camera are randomly dispersed in the area (as an air-drop in a battlefield) and the aim is to select the cameras in order to maximize the coverage of the cameras turn on detection mode. The solution proposed by Liu et al. in \cite{38*liu2010} is to use a constructive algorithms. The network of camera self-recognized by a talk between each smart cameras. Also each smart cameras is able to estimate precisely this localization, it is an important assumption to select the cameras. The solution proposed is directly inspired by the distributed network talks. \\
To begin all sensor are in sleepy mode. The camera wake up regularly and send a call at the neighbour, if they receive no answer that mean no other camera is awake around and the camera stay in detection mode. If no enough answers have been received, that mean the required density of the camera around are not enough. Thus the camera stay turn on detection mode. Otherwise the camera return on sleepy mode until another wake-up later. This procedure is applied in each smart camera with all have their own pace. After a certain time the network is well organize to cover the area in detection mode. The area is considered covered when the density of camera is good enough. \\
 The method introduce by Liu et al. in \cite{38*liu2010} is efficient enough. The solution proposed has the advantage to can work in wide area and to be dynamic. As example if a camera do not have any more power the network will self-recognize.  
This algorithms is efficient with a high density of sensor to have a relatively low coverage (just enough to detect target in the sparse sensor placement). Also the method presented is really dependent then the network communication and the capability to localize precisely each sensor. Finally the solution proposed to select a set of sensor among a randomly posed sensor is not enough optimized and precise (see illustration in Figure \ref{fig:Coverage38}). 
	\begin{figure}[t!]
	\center
\minipage{0.65\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/From38Liu.png}
  \caption{Illustration of  the  area coverage with smart cameras with an target tracking objective. The smart cameras can be in 3 modes (sleepy, detecting , locating). Experiment made in Liu et al. \citep{38*liu2010}}\label{fig:Coverage38}
  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure} 

Another cameras pose estimation by construction is proposed by Höster et al. \cite{171*horster2006}.
The solutions proposed is based on a greedy search heuristic. The objective is to find the positions and orientations for a set of cameras with a fixe pan, in the environment inspired by the AGP. \\
In \cite{171*horster2006} a first greedy search solution has been presented before an other algorithms with extend the greedy solution. The algorithms developed in \cite{171*horster2006} is called Dual Sampling.\\
The dual sampling is an incremental method. 
First step, is to initialize the position of all the cameras. A random initialization for the position and the orientation must be appropriate.  \\
Second step, is to select one point of the area non covered yet. The area is discretized by several points, with each point must be covered by at least one camera. Around the selected point several position and orientation are tested for the cameras at proximity. The possible position are obtained by sampling the area around the point to cover. Finally the best cameras position and orientation is kept. The best cameras positions and orientations depend then the number of other points globally covered in the area. 
The second step, is repeated and the set of uncovered control points are reduced at each iteration. This procedure is applied until the stopping criterion are reached. That mean enough points of the area are covered. \\
The constructive solution have some inconvenient notably in terms of efficiency. Indeed this solution is limited by the number of cameras and size of the area due to the exponential difficulty. %In fact, bigger area mean more point and more camera mean more position and orientation to test at each iteration.

In Nikolaidis et al. \cite{81*nikolaidis2009} the cameras placement is studied for cover a basic mobile robot trajectory.
The trajectory of the mobile robot is modelled as the regions of interest, with a gradually decreasing interested from the trajectory center.\\
  The solution applied in \cite{81*nikolaidis2009} is to do a local optimization one camera after another with the “steepest decent method (related to  the gradient decent)”. If this local optimization give a better solution the network of camera is modified otherwise the cameras stay at the same place. This operation is repeated until the convergent arrangement is obtained or no more upgrade can be found. The result presented in the experiment done by Nikolaidis in  \cite{81*nikolaidis2009} are interesting despite the simplicity of the area and the very small amount of cameras used (no more then four). The principal limitation is due to the number of steps required for optimize independently each camera of the network. Also a multitude of local optimisation is not obviously the same or better then the global optimization.

Ma et al. \cite{37*ma2012} propose a solution for the problem of finding the minimum cameras barrier coverage. The objective is to cover only the boundary of an area, to be able to detect target intrusion in the perimeters. The perimeter is relatively wide and can be considering at some point as an area to cover composed by big hole in this center.\\
 The region to cover is cut in numerous sub-region. The region are inter connected, each sub-region have to be “full-view covered”. The full-view covered is defined ; if for any direction of the target there always exist a camera to monitor the face of it.\\
The solution purposed is based on constructive solution with adapted heuristic. The heuristic used is presented in detail in \cite{37*ma2012}. The global idea is to cut the perimeter in different sub-regions and applies the method proposed to have a full-view coverage at each sub-region. 
The cutting on sub-region offer at the heuristic to work in reasonable time due to this restricted area.\\
The solution proposed though this efficiency in the case of barrier coverage is not rely appropriate for vast coverage area. The first limitation is the number of cameras use to fully cover the area. The important number of cameras is mainly due to this definition of “full view covered”. That definition imply many overlaps to have the multi directions coverage.

The previous solutions and algorithms presented in \cite{38*liu2010, 37*ma2012,81*nikolaidis2009,171*horster2006} are based on constructive methods for the cameras placement and their local optimization. Each camera is individually placed depending than the network with an iterative process. The iterative process has to chose the best position for each camera of the set. This methods has some consequence, nobly the fast increasing number of iterations required to have a solution good enough for each camera. The time complexity is event more problematic with increasing the size of the area and even more with the number of cameras. Also these solutions are extremely dependent than the formulation and the constraints and cannot be easily adapted to other closely related problems (new constraints  or modified objectives). The rigidity of adaptation is mostly due to the  use of heuristic  design for  very specific problems. 

\subsection{Linear programming optimisation and limits}
	Different method of linear optimization was applied and test. In some case, due to a well-adapted formulation; a specific shape of the area or cameras number the linear optimisation is efficient. 
The linear optimisation  has been  tested in the literature  in order to have a  reference point to compare  the other more appropriate solutions (as example \cite{,151*zhao2013,82*chrysostomou2012}).
	%The linear optimisation has been tested to have initial result in order to have a reference point before to develop other solution .  
%	The reason ofIn some other case the method was studied but finally rejected du to this fast limitation 
	 The linear optimisation  is finally rejected due to this fast limitation.  Indeed the linear optimization can be quickly in difficulty due to the fast increasing complexity of the problem and in many case be locked in local minima. 
	 The flowing section show the interest and the limit of the linear programming based on example from the literature.

%%\textbf{!!!!!! partie manguante sur l'utilation des methode linear  !!!!!(voir path planning)}
% non linear	 141*akbarzadeh2013,33*reddy2012 
	 \subsubsection{Linear programming}
	 The linear programming is applicable for the linear and convex problems in order to minimize a linear and convex cost function.\\
In Erdem et al. \cite{43*erdem2006} is based on AGP and the WSN to propose a fusion off their two paradigms. Some modification have been done as example to take in account the field of view limitation. The interesting aspect is how some camera properties have been modelled to fit to the problem of AGP.  \\
The solution proposed being workable with using an omnidirectional or considering a PTZ as omnidirectional cameras by using an efficient angular sweeping. The simile omnidirectional cameras are simulated by PTZ camera with a non-continue zoom  as in the experimentation proposed in \cite{43*erdem2006}. Where the PTZ can have two focal lengths at 50mm and  35mm. 
Finally the solution proposed is to discretize the area to cover and also the different possible parameters for a camera (as: localization, orientation, focal...). In order to have a combinatorial formulation of the problem. Thanks to this formulation close than the Binary Integer Programming (BIP) and apply a well-known method “Branch and Bound” in order to optimize the cameras placement.  \\
This solution  proposes a  good  coverage with the minimum of cameras in a reasonable time. The main limit of the solution is due to  the  use of omnidirectional or simile omnidirectional cameras.% until, the  number of location sample, the numbers of cameras, and the number of parameters possible for the camera stay relatively  reduced.  \\
 
Zhao  et al. \cite{22*zhao2008} are trying to find the optimal position for a set of cameras in order to maximize an indoor area coverage (similar than an art gallery room). The coverage of an indoor area is not the only objective, but the requirement to can  do an efficient tags detection.
The solution proposed for the coverage is to adapt the number of points of interest which must be covered by the camera depending than the coverage rate. \\
The area is discretized with a grid.  The grid is composed by points selected smartly. Each point of the grid simulate a potential location of the target.
The camera position is limited at few position fixed on the room boundary.
% number of possible position for the camera (the boundary of the room) are defined.
The adapted grid and the limited cameras positioning are used to limit the size of the search space (as number of possible solution). Thanks to this limited search space a linear optimization with the BIP can be used. \\
Use a BIP is popular and others use it as in \cite{22*zhao2008,43*erdem2006}. In \cite{22*zhao2008} the solution proposed is to use BIP formulation, the smart sampling of the grid and branch and bound form LP\_solve libraries to optimize the cameras positions and orientations.

% A Similar method is used in \cite{27*bodor2005} to find the position and orientation of a set of cameras. The goal of this paper is to find the appropriate position with maximize the resolution for a set of cameras dedicate to do tracking. The position is determined depending on a set of standard pedestrian trajectories. The camera pose try to maximize the given trajectory to have the best resolution and the entire coverage. \\
%The problem is also formulate in order to apply a linear well-known algorithm. In this case the branch and bound is applied.  

\subsubsection{Limitation of linear method}
The methods of linear optimization were applied and tested to answer the problem of camera position for maximum coverage. In some case, due to a well-adapted formulation or a restricted area and cameras number, this solution is efficient enough. In some other case the method was studied, but finally rejected due to this fast limitation (as example \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013,151*zhao2013,82*chrysostomou2012}). Indeed the linear optimization can be quickly in difficulty due to the fast increasing complexity of the problem and in many case be lock in local minima.

In Wang et al. \cite{181*wang2017} propose a solution with an atypical problem formulation. The solution proposed in \cite{181*wang2017} is mainly based on the method of discretize the area. The idea is to have an area discretized with precision with use the minimum of points. To do that the solution proposed is to decompose the area in order to give more points in the grid was the shape of the room need it to be correctly described. \\
The principal advantage of this solution is to propose an area representation with enough precision and a minimum of points to describe it. Less points to describe the area to cover mean also a winning time efficiency in computation during the cameras pose estimation (cost function is faster).
Despite this interesting solution the result presented in the experiment does not appear to be conclusive.  

The principal problem of the linear optimisation appears when the problem became complex. The complexity can come form the  problem formulation and some extra constraints. But most of the time the increased complexity is coming from the increased size of the search space. Concretely when the goal is to place a more important number of cameras or when the number of positions and orientations are too important the linear optimisation begin to be inefficient. 
	
\subsection{Game theory} 
	 
Among possible solution an atypical method is to use the game theory \cite{19*li2013}. The game theory is use to optimize the looking direction of the cameras as in \cite{12*soto2009,18*ding2012,19*li2013,25*song2008}. These articles are based on game theory to find an equilibrium (also named Nash equilibrium) between two contradictory objectives. The objectives are in one side to maximize the resolution and  in the other side the multi target tracking.

Soto et al. \cite{12*soto2009} propose a network of a dozen of PTZ cameras. That mean the position of the cameras are fix and the solution proposed is to find the best orientations with the appropriate focal lens to track most of the targets.  \\
 To do that the camera are smart enough to communicate with the close neighbours and adapt the pan, tilt, zoom depending on the needs.
The need has been defined by an utility function (or local cost function). The goal is to track most of the target as possible with the better resolution. The cameras scores when it obtained a desired resolution of the images for all the targets visible by the networks.\\
The trade-off proposed is between the multi tracking and the best coverage resolution for each target. The multi-target problematic can appear far from maximization of the coverage. But the number of targets which may be higher than the number of cameras. The higher number of target push the cameras tracking to be an interesting solution to maximize the coverage of an area. In this case, the quality of the coverage will also dependent then the number of targets and the importance of the resolution constraint.  \\
	 In \cite{18*ding2012} and \cite{25*song2008} different experiments have been proposed with a number of targets  slightly increased. In this article the game theory is applied to trade-off between the tracking and the resolutions. The proposed experiment is based on the decentralized method. It is justified by the complexity to dynamically adapt all the cameras of the network at same time, depending on each target trajectory.\\
	  Furthermore, the decentralized solution is more adapted to prevent the security issue, as wrong transitions and interceptions by hostile opponents. The security may be an important factor in many applications. \\
To have the decentralized system the cameras must have some autonomy. \\
In the experiment proposed in \cite{12*soto2009} and \cite{18*ding2012,25*song2008} each camera are smart enough to have their own tracking and control module. Also the camera are able to communicate with each other, until to reach a consensus. The consensus is when a Nash equilibrium is found between the two contradictory objectives. In this case it is a win win situation for both objectives.\\
So the objectives are not independently optimize, moreover the solution proposed have to optimize its  simultaneously in order to reach a consensus. The consensus is reached when it became impossible to upgrade one of the objectives without downgraded the other one.\\
  In the experiment of \cite{18*ding2012,25*song2008} the consensus is found thank the cameras communication. The cameras communication have to maximize numbers of  target covered with the higher resolution.
 The experiment is based on numerous targets moving freely in the area. Also in \cite{18*ding2012} one of the target must be cover in priority with a high resolution. That have an impact on the other camera position.
 The result of the experiment as in Figure \ref{fig:CoverageFrom18} form \cite{18*ding2012} show a really efficient global coverage with almost all the target cover at every time despite the movements of the targets. \\
 The advantage of these solutions is the acceptable result and dynamic reconfiguration of the system for the reasonable size of the area and the decentralized computations.\\ 
Otherwise this method have some limit, as show in the experiment the area is relatively restricted and numerous cameras with a fixed position are useful. The consequences is the quantity of overlap, relatively important. In this case the number of sensors is not well optimize to cover the area. Moreover to use properly this method for maximum coverage it requires a large number of simulated target in the region to observe (require to have more targets then cameras).  Finally this solution is more adapted for a self-reorganization for a set of PTZ cameras.

	 \subsection{Sum-up} 
	 In order to summarise the previous section a Table \ref{tab:sum-up1} is proposed with contain the interesting articles. The first column is for the reference, the author name and the year. The second column is dedicate to  the best solution used. In fact some articles has tries few methods only the best is named here. The next columns are dedicated to precise the  optimized parameters. The \ding{52} in the X and Y column indicate  if the solutions proposed optimize the cameras position along the X and  Y axis. If  it is noted by a random dispersion is mean the cameras are randomly dispersed in the map and when the cases are filled with 0 is to indicate non optimization of the position.
	 The columns Pan, Tilt and Roll show with a \ding{52} the solutions which propose to optimize the rotation of the cameras. The 8$^th$ column are used to precise if the focal lens is optimized or fixed.  When the focal lens are optimized but with a discrete  range of values the annotation "(discrete)" appear. The 9$^th$ column show the area representation. This representation is manly effective on the grid design. The 10$^th$ column show the maximum number of camera placed  and optimized during the experimentations presented in the articles. The last columns  is are dedicated to specifies  the possible secondary objectives which have to be optimize.

	\section{Solution based on evolutionary  method} \label{sec:SolutionBasedonEA}
	
	The solutions approached, formulate the problem of camera positioning for a maximum coverage (as in the section \ref{sec:NonEAmethod}) from various points of views. Until now the formulations and solutions the more common have not been approach yet.
In numerous works the cameras positioning for maximum coverage is assimilated to a problem of optimization. Due to the complexity of the problem (as that was introduced in the AGP section \ref{sec:AGP}) the linear optimization or based on heuristic may not be appropriate.  
The other solution, is to apply some stochastic method with an appropriate meta-heuristic. Among the various possibilities the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) has been used at numerous times. 
The following sections, are focused on the different algorithms  based on the EA. The EA family are commonly used in the literature to optimize a set of cameras for maximum coverage depending than different secondary objectives.

\subsection{Among the EA algorithms}
In this subsection different algorithms to solve the problem of camera positioning is discussed. The algorithms presented try to optimize the coverage depending then different specific constraints with different formulation adapted to the constraints.

The work of Zhao et al. \cite{151*zhao2013} present few solutions to optimize the positions of a cameras set. Among the solution proposed a greedy with a local optimization, an integer programming with a solver, a sampling algorithms and the Simulated Annealing (SA) from the EA family has been compared. Also the SA is used to customize the sampling mechanism in order to propose a new customized solution. 
In Zhao et al. \cite{151*zhao2013}, the problem is formalized as a BIP (binary integer programming).
  The goal is to find among a restricted numbers of possible positions and orientations the best pose for a set of cameras. The best pose for the set of cameras has to cover the area, despite of the obstacles and the regions of interest. \\
Among the solutions proposed, the greedy algorithm has a good approximate solution, as long as the number of cameras stay relatively small. The problem of the greedy algorithm and the integer programming solver is to have an important risk to be stocked in the local optimum (local minima). This risk increases proportionally then the size of the environment. Otherwise the sampling technique with the SA is more adapted to the problem with times constraint and offer a well solution.\\
Despite that the solution proposed have some limitations. The major limitation is due to the experiment proposed. In fact, the experiment is made in a very small room with only few poses possible for each camera. Consequently, the solution proposed can appear better than a real situation and must be widely worst in a bigger area (in terms of time computation and optimisation of the poses). The more interesting aspect in this work \citep{151*zhao2013} is the use of the SA form the EA family which allows to have an efficient coverage much faster than the integer programming solver for a similar result. 

In the recent work of Akbarzadeh et al. \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013} the cameras positioning for outside area, have been designed as an optimization problem with a few algorithms tested. Among the solution tested the SA and GA (Genetic Algorithm) both form the EA Family. 
The work of Akbarzadeh et al. \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013} are interesting in many points. \\
The problem formulation is one of the interesting points. The goal is to cover an outside area with  multi coverage (exactly a $k-$coverage  discussed later in the  section \ref{sec:zoneOfInterest}), the relief of the terrain and obstacles with may generate potential occlusion. 
Due to several relief of the considered maps, the cameras  are always pose at the same distance then the floor  depending then the floor altitude. Like that the altitude of a camera is automatically deduced form his position and the relief associate. Moreover, depending then the position and orientation of the cameras the relief can be a source of occlusion for the cameras and has to be taken in account.
%The cameras are always pose at the same distance then the floor despite the altitude and depending on the position  and orientation of the cameras the  occlusion generate by the obstacle and the relief has been computed. 
%All these elements combined make the problem formulation relatively complete and realistic.
%Trea is composed by some region with a  multi coverage constraints . 
%Due to the relief of the ground the cameras may not be pose always at constant altitude. The solution proposed is to  place the  camera at fix distance then the ground floor despite the altitude. 
 %The cameras are always pose at the same distance then the floor despite the altitude and depending on the position and orientation of the cameras the occlusion generate by the obstacle and the relief has been computed.
All these elements combined make the problem formulation relatively complete and realistic.\\
 Among the solution studied in \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013}, the non-linear have been tested with a quasi-Newton optimization method (called BFGS see in \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013} section C), the SA and the CMA-ES  form the EA family with some mechanism close then a Genetic algorithm (see in \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013} section D) have been tested too.
The result of the comparison gives a net advantage of the algorithms from the EA family in term of coverage rate with a fix number of cameras but also in term of time computation. 
 The SA gives a close coverage rate (some time slightly better) than the CMA-ES and also the SA have a better time computation. Otherwise the CMA-ES is the more efficient in average with a reasonable time computation close than SA. The advantage of the CMA-ES appears more important in the bigger area. The quasi-newton and other algorithms tested are far away in terms of time and coverage, compared to the EA solutions.  The conclusion of this work \cite{141*akbarzadeh2013} is  is the efficiency of the EA algorithm in a vast and realistic environments.
 
 In Chrysostomou and Gasteratos \cite{82*chrysostomou2012} present an optimization system for maximum coverage with several constraints for 2 closely related problems. In the first time, the goal is to cover an inside area inspired by the AGP with a minimum of cameras.  The minimum is fixed depending  on a coverage threshold required rate. In the second time, the goal is to maximize the coverage for a fix number of cameras. This 2 problems are relatively close and just few elements has to be adapted to pass from on to another problem.\\
The coverage of the area is related to the camera visibility and few constraints has been proposed to control it, as the visibility, viewing angle, field of view, resolution, viewing distance, and occlusions. The solution proposed to optimize the positions, orientations and some of the camera parameters (as the focal lengths) is to apply an algorithm form the EA family called Bee Colony. The Bee Colony is inspired by the Ant colony algorithm and associate to the bee exploration in the nature. The Bee Colony is in this  paper \cite{82*chrysostomou2012} the more efficient of the two problems formulation (minimum of cameras and maximum of coverage with a fix number of cameras) after a brief comparison with a GA and a broach and bound algorithms. \\
The experiment proposed is relatively limited. Only one room has been tested with only one test per algorithm, which is not relevant for stochastic algorithm (due to the importance of randomness). Despite that the result proposed are encouraging. 

The works proposed in this section has the common point to apply different algorithms form the EA family to optimise the problem maximize the coverage for cameras positioning. The algorithms form the EA family appear well adapted to the problem. To go further in the EA some specific branch as the GA has to be studied.

\subsection{Solution used Genetic Algorithm or close related}

 Among the solutions applied from the EA to optimise the coverage area, the GA or the algorithms closely related has been studied, as in the following section with some examples.
 In the solutions proposed as in \cite{82*chrysostomou2012,33*reddy2012,141*akbarzadeh2013} the GA have been applied as a comparator. The GA and solution strongly inspired by the GA  are not only used as a comparator, but it can appear more efficient as in \cite{83*van2009,101*topcuoglu2009,165*jiang2010,152*wang2009}.


In Van et al. \cite{83*van2009} the problem of cameras positioning for video surveillance to control a building is studied. A building with several floors is examined and must be covered by a set of cameras. To do that the environment has to be considered in the three dimensions (3D) with the ceiling occlusion. The solution proposed being to fix the altitude of the cameras for each level of the building and considering each level as one independent room to  optimize. 
The optimization is based on a basic GA with a customized crossover and mutation in order to fit the problems. 
For the crossover a swap is done between two cameras form different sets.% For the crossover a swap between two cameras from two sets of camera position (chromosomes)
 About the mutation, a Gaussian is used to mutate some parameters of the cameras in a set. The GA is used with an elitist selections. All these parameters of the GA are essential to have an appropriate optimization adapted  to the problems and to understand the performance of it (more detail about the GA and these parameters see the next Section \ref{sec:GAdetail}).  \\ 
Finally the area is covered with 32 cameras (for 3 levels) with relatively good coverage. Few black hole and an acceptable level of overlapping. In this case, the GA is well appropriate and works efficiently.

In Jiang et al. \cite{165*jiang2010} the solution for the coverage problem in a wide area with the regions of interest and obstacles have been optimized with using a standard GA. In \cite{165*jiang2010} the GA has been tested for a wide area with numerous cameras orient. The goal is to find the best orientations to maximize the coverage for a set of cameras  randomly placed in the space. The experiment has been done in a vast area $400X300m^2$ with 60 cameras.
 All the cameras has the same depth and field of view. The number of cameras are not enough to control the full area and some choice must be done between the different regions of interest. The GA proposed in this article offer the best result around 47\%, with a minimum of overlapping. \\
The solution proposed with the GA is interesting and work well to optimize the orientation of the cameras in  a relatively big and complex area. The main element missing in the solution proposed is an experiment with a number of cameras supposedly enough to fully cover the area. 

In Wang et al. \cite{152*wang2009} a variant of the classical GA has been used. The Multi-Agent Genetic Algorithm (MAGA is from \cite{223*zhong2004})) have been developed by the fusion of 2 algorithms, the GA and the multi agents systems. The principal advantage of this algorithm is this supposed efficiency on the optimization for a huge number of dimensions (Zhong et al. estimate the efficiency range around 20 to 10 000 dimensions). In this case, the number of dimensions means the number of parameters to optimize for a given problem.\\
MAGA is used in \cite{152*wang2009} to optimize the area coverage. The area to cover is a 3D space area and most of the volumetric space have to be covered.  Unlike the other articles the cameras have to be positioned in the 3 dimensions (in x, y and z) and the orientation too. The constraints of volumetric space associate to the optimization of the position, orientation and cameras property, increase greatly the size of the search space (also  the number of dimension to optimize).  
Despite this interesting solution the experiment proposed are not enough consistent to properly judge it. Despite that the MAGA appear promising in term of  potential increasing search space and answer quality. 

In Topcuoglu et al. \cite{101*topcuoglu2009} the solution proposed is a Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms (HEA).  The HEA is based on the GA with different modifications, notably on the operators. As example, the crossover is redesigned in order to have two different parts of it. 
One of the parts is a local crossover and the other is a more classical crossover.  
The HEA proposed in this article is relatively close than another EA algorithms called the Mimetic algorithms. 
The solution applied in \cite{101*topcuoglu2009} is  presented with different experimentation dedicate  to maximize the visibility and minimize the cost of the sensors network. The experiments propose to compare a simple random selection to the HEA. The result of this experiment shows a real efficiency in terms of minimizing the number of useful sensors and the total utility (the utility is related then the multi objectives.) \\

In view of these articles, the GA appears appropriate for the optimization of numerous cameras in  a vast area as show in \cite{165*jiang2010}. The GA optimization can be a good starting point to develop a new method by tuning and customizing the numerous parameters as in \cite{101*topcuoglu2009,152*wang2009}  or \cite{83*van2009}. Also despite the example presented  the GA is relatively under-exploited in view of this customized ability and efficiency.


\subsection{Solution used Particle swarm optimization or close related}

  \endminipage\hfill
\end{figure} 

To maximize the coverage despite various constraints the EA family are commonly used with different algorithm as showed. But the algorithms the most commonly used and not discussed yet, is the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as in \cite{84*xu2011,8*zhou2011,33*reddy2012,143*maji2015,193*fu2014,194*fu2010,200*kulkarni2011}. In this following section, the use of PSO and similar algorithms is discussed for the problem of coverage optimization. 

 In Xu et al. \cite{84*xu2011} the PSO is used to optimize the orientation of several cameras (around 150).
The cameras have been randomly posed on the area. Each camera have the same properties and cannot change its position, but may adjust its orientation to any directions (as a PTZ cameras). The area is designed in 2D and the looking direction is described with only one rotation in pan (around  the z axis).  
Finally the PSO is used to optimize the looking directions in order to have the best coverage as possible. The PSO optimize the area to reach a coverage around 65\% after 1000 iteration and 20 particles for each iteration.
The gain between the initial random dispersion  and the optimized looking direction (with PSO) is  around 12 points of percentage. The intimal coverage in the experiment was around 53\% after the random dispersion (see the result in Figure \ref{fig:Coverage84}. In this case, the PSO allow with a relatively quick optimization a much better solution.

In Fu.x et al. \cite{194*fu2010} the same problem as \cite{84*xu2011} is discussed. The optimization of the orientation for an important set of cameras (100 cameras) using PSO. The difference is the number of parameters to optimize. In \cite{194*fu2010} the looking direction is not only optimized on pan but also with the tilt.  
The PSO is compared with other algorithms as the SA. Finally the PSO outperform the other solution experimented in this article despite an important number of parameters to optimize (100 cameras with 2 parameters by camera).

In Zhou et al. in \cite{8*zhou2011} the objective is to cover an indoor area inspired by the AGP to detects targets. The room is represented by a set of possible target positions. The coverage of the target is optimize for a fix number of cameras. 
 The experiment made in \cite{8*zhou2011} show the ability of PSO in term of efficiency and speed compares than a hierarchical method. The proposed hierarchical approached is a greedy constructive heuristic (see more in \cite{8*zhou2011} section III). The experiment is made in a basic square room described by a grid of 81 possible targets location with all have the same importance and have to be covered. \\
The result of the experiment did it in \cite{8*zhou2011}, shown the slightly advantage of the hierarchical method. In fact, the hierarchical method give a better solution, but require a much more time computation.
Otherwise the PSO propose an efficient  solution close then the hierarchical method. The solution proposed by the PSO is also time efficient, between 2 too  6 time faster than the hierarchical method.  The PSO combines result efficiency and fast time computation. The PSO appears more adapted to a realistic solution due to fast and efficient answer. Conversely the experiment proposed can be considered as limited due to the  poor  number of possible targets location in a simple room and the low level of choice for the cameras poses. 
An experiment in a bigger environment will probably shown an even more important gap between the PSO and the Hierarchical method.

As in Zhou et al. \cite{8*zhou2011}, Reddy et al. \cite{33*reddy2012} propose a similar solution for a similar problem formulation. The goal is to maximize the coverage depending on some target priority with must maximize the resolution using PSO.
Moreover the solution proposed in \cite{33*reddy2012} is also taking into account the visibility parameters as depth of field and light intensity in a room inspired by the AGP. All these constraints affects greatly the coverage resulst. Finally the experiment did it shown the efficiency of PSO for a small environment with few camera (around 7 cameras) for a multi objectives problem. The advantage in \cite{33*reddy2012} is the addition of more objectives and constraints than in \cite{8*zhou2011}. Moreover the area has a better discretization and allow to confirm the efficiency of PSO for the coverage with multi objectives in a small room.

In Fu.y \cite{193*fu2014} the PSO is use to optimise the problem of maximum coverage as the other. 
 The camera pose (with the orientation) need to covered the totality of a small square room.
The orientation of the camera has to be optimized in pan and tilt. In addition, all the cameras have an identical focal lens. It is a relatively basic objective with few common constraints. 
 The interesting part of this article \cite{193*fu2014} is the use of PI-PSO with is a Probability Inspired binary PSO. 
 To use this algorithm the problem have to be adapted. This adaptation give an original formulation based on a combinatorial problems. Despite the atypical formulation the solution proposed is greedy in term of cameras for cover a small space without obstacles. 
 
 In the recent work of Maji et al.\cite{143*maji2015} the finality is different but the problem can be considering close then the problem of cameras positioning. 
The objective is to position several transistors in a rectangular Printed Circuit Board (PCB).
The transistors must have a rectangular shape with different sizes and ratios. 
  Despite the apparent simplicity the several rectangular shape for the chips. Some potential additional constraints, as the relation dependence between chips, or the strict non-overlapping of the transistors, makes the problem of positioning transistor becomes more complex. The solution is to optimize the positions and orientations of the chips on the board using EA. The  PSO is chosen and more precisely the Craziness based PSO (CR-PSO). The interest of the CR-PSO is the variety introduce during the optimization compare then a classical PSO. The variety introduced during the optimisation process by the CR-PSO  helps to pass over the several local minima. 
  The more interesting aspect is to use a PSO in a similar problem then cameras positioning which was commonly answered with a linear convex optimisation as in \citep{62*vijayan1991} and  based on the work on the floor planning defined Boyd and Vandenberghe in their book Convex optimization \cite{boyd2004convex}(8.8 page 438).  
  
The solutions proposed is based on PSO are promising. The PSO or closely related have numerous advantages as showed in the previous articles.
 The main advantages are the efficient and fast optimisation, as well as the fast implementation. In fact, the PSO is  relatively easy to implement and just few parameters need to be set-up before to have an efficient result. The simplicity of the implementation is due to the numerous framework developed in all languages and the low numbers of parameters to set-up. Among the  few parameters to set-up manly the number of particles and the global inertia have an important impact (see more about PSO latter in the Section  \ref{sec:PSOdetail}).
  On another side the PSO is not really efficient  to optimize a lot of dimension at same time (compare then other EA). The PSO can quickly be limited as the increasing size and complexity of the area.
   Due to this limit the PSO has been customized as in \citep{143*maji2015}  and \citep{194*fu2010}. \\
The popularity of the PSO is mostly due to the association of the quick implementation, fast computation and efficient enough optimisation for various problem as coverage optimization.
 
 \subsection{Sum-up} 
 In order to summarise the previous section a Table \ref{tab:sum-upEA} is proposed with contain the interesting articles.
 The first column  is dedicate to the references, the authors name  and years.
  The second is dedicate to  the best algorithms. In these articles most of the time several solutions has been tested. The second column show the best algorithm among the algorithms tested. The third column notify if among the other algorithms tested some of them which are from the EA  family. The 4$^{th}$,  5$^{th}$ and 6$^{th}$ column precise if the algorithm proposed optimize respectively on x,y and z coordinated the position of the cameras. In some case the position on x and y are not optimize  but randomly dispersed. The 7$^{th}$,  8$^{th}$ and 9$^{th}$ column precise if the algorithm proposed optimize respectively on pan, tilt and roll rotation of the cameras (if no optimization the orientation is fixed). The 10$^{th}$ column is dedicate to precise if the focal length is optimized or fixed. The column for coverage representation  precise the area to cover is designed in  2D or 3D (11$^{th}$ column). In some case, the 2D representation of the area is enriched (noted with a "+" or "+relief"). The 12$^{th}$  column show if the experiments proposed are indoor or outdoor (in, out). The 13$^{th}$  column is dedicated to show the maximum number of cameras tested in the experiments.  
 The last columns are  dedicated to list the main secondary objective and constraints.

\section{Coverage path planning}\label{sec:CppLiterattur}

The coverage path planning  as objective to design  the more efficient path to cover an area. the path as to cover all or  at least most of the area using  the shorter path. 
The solutions put forward in the literature until now is to keep on eyes a vast area composed by numerous obstacles was to pose numerous cameras or robotics cameras (as PTZ cameras and smart camera).
The solutions proposed until now are interesting only to monitor a vast area  in continue with several cameras. 
The disadvantage of positioning a set of cameras appears quickly with the cost. The expensive cost is due to the several cameras and the communication network required to can centralize the collected images. All the images must be collected in a real time. This costly system is not always useful. 
In fact, in some application the area needs to be controlled periodically. The periodic control of the area does not require an installation for the set of fixed cameras. Until now the installation was composed by a set of immovable cameras unlike the solution presented in section see Section \ref{sec:SolutionBasedonEA} and Section \ref{sec:NonEAmethod}).
 The periodical control requirement can be illustrate with some example :  The cartographies with need just one fly over an area roughly bounded as in \citep{66*galceran2013,164*valente2013}, forest fire detection which require a periodic fly over specific and vast region as in \cite{237*casbeer2006}, the hoovering robots with need to cover all the room with some time some on-line computation \citep{218*meiting2007,216*luo2002,215*lee2010,196*yang2004}  and the agriculture.
 About the agriculture application, an UAV need to fly over the field few times the year in order to control by photography the hydration, the maturity and any thing else of the field as in \citep{164*valente2013,203*zarco2008,63*chao2008,105*long199,167*barrientos2011,177*lelong2008}. %\textbf{revoir les ref et trié un peu}.
For all these applications the area must be covered but does not need a coverage of all the area instantly and continuously. The solution commonly proposed is to use only one sensor mounted on a mobile robot. The Mobile robot need to be adapted to the task and the environment, as flying  \citep{105*long1991}, driving \citep{30*bodor2005,213*roberts2008}, swimming \cite{66*galceran2013}. The mobile robot with the sensor moves in the space to cover all the area. In this case, the objective is to determine the best path for the mobile robot to cover  the area. The best path is dependent then the constraint of each problem. However, the common point, is to have the shorter path to all the area or at least most of it.
The following section is focused on finding the best Coverage Path Planing (CPP) for a sensor mounted on a mobile robot. The sensor can be varied, but the great majority of the case it is a camera perspective. To estimate the best CPP different algorithms and methodologies has been applied in the literature to solve or at least optimize the CPP problems.

  The following sections is focussed on the different algorithms and methodologies applied to solve or at least optimize the coverage path planning problem. In a first time, the watchman route problem is introduced to highlight the origin of the CPP problem and the relation with the cameras positioning for optimal coverage. In a second time, the more popular solutions are discussed.

\subsection{AGP  to watchman route problem}\label{sec:WRP}


Before to explore the solutions proposed for the CPP is essential to understand the role of the Watchman Route Problem (WRP). The WRP is closely related than the CPP and the WRP has impacted the research for the CPP. 
The following sections are focused on the definition of the WRP, the solution proposed in order to solve it, and finally a fast discussion of the limit of the WRP  is proposed.
 
\subsubsection{Definition of the watchmen route problem }

 \begin{mfigures}[!]
{Watchman route problems answer illustration. }{fig:WRPillust} \centering
\mfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{img/WRPillustration.png}{}{subfig:WRPi}
\hspace{1cm}
\end{mfigures}	
The Watchman Route Problem is introduced for the first time by Chin and Ntafos in 1987 \cite{54*chin1988}. The problem of the WRP can be summarized in one sentence :

\textbf{"How to calculate a shortest route contained inside a polygon such that any points inside this polygon is visible from at least one point of the route?"}.  

The guard has to cover an area represented by a polygon (see the illustration of the problems in Figure \figref{fig:WRPillust}). The guards is considered as perfect with no restriction in the field of view (the guard can see at $360^\circ$) and no restriction in the depth field (the guard can see form on extremity of the room to another. The guard can see the opposed wall excepted if an obstacle obstruct the view). The guard ability are directly inspired by the AGP (see \ref{sec:AGP})
The shape of the polygon is primordial and affect greatly the possible answer and the complexity to solve the WRP.
The WRP problem is by many aspects closely related than the AGP. The AGP (see Section \ref{sec:AGP}) is commonly considered as the root of the WRP.
 In fact, the WRP is not only focussed on standing position, but on finding an optimal path. The path has to be optimized to cover all the points which compose the polygon  and the path have to be shorter as possible.
 
% A common way to build a path with as to cover a polygon can be to search the waypoints  which compose the path. Once the waypoints found the next step is to compute a path passing by all the previously founded waypoints. 
 The next section introduces the possible method and algorithm usable in order to solve or atleast optimize a solution for a WRP.

\subsubsection{Solution} 

The WRP problem can be solve in some condition. The solution to solve it are applicable only if the polygon is simple. A polygon is considered as simple, when the boundary of it are composed of continue straight lines that do not intersect between them. To complete this definition, it is important to precise the simple polygon does not have a hole (see Figure \figref{fig:simplePoly}). 
 \begin{mfigures}[!]
{Few example to illustrate the simple polygon. }{fig:simplePoly} \centering
\mfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{img/SimplPolygonA.png}{Example of simple polygons.}{subfig:SimplePoly}
\hspace{1cm}
\mfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{img/SimplPolygonB.png}{Example of non simple polygons.}{subfig:nonSimplePoly}
\hspace{1cm}
\end{mfigures}	

To solve the WRP few algorithms were developed. Step by step the algorithms proposed in the literature allow a faster solution. The first interesting algorithm for the WRP with the simple polygon is the early work of Tan et al \cite{234*tan2001}. In Tan et al.\citep{234*tan2001}  propose an algorithm for a fast computation time. The solution proposed work in the simple polygon composed by $n$ vertices in a polynomial time $O(n^5)$. \\
Others algorithms proposed to go a bit further. Dror et al. \cite{233*dror2003} assume to have a better  time complexity. In fact, in \cite{233*dror2003} the solution proposed for the WRP in a simple polygon is working in $O(n^3 log n)$.  The deterministic solution applied is also usable in closely relate problem of the WRT as the zoo-keeper problem and safari problem.
This two algorithms \citep{234*tan2001,233*dror2003} are usable only in the case of simple polygons to delivered the optimal solution which is the shortest path for a full room coverage. 

To have a more general solutions for WRP, the proposition is to have an efficient algorithm working also with complex polygons. A solution is to look for an efficient approximation. An efficient approximation means a path short enough.  Due to the computation method the optimality of the path can not be certified as the best.
Several efficient approximations has been proposed as in \citep{235*faigl2010} and \citep{53*packer2008}. 

In Packer \citep{53*packer2008}  the algorithm proposed is based on splitting the problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is to find a set of points with can be good enough to cover all the area despite a restricted visibility range. These points are called waypoints.  
Once the set of waypoints to cover all the polygon are found, the second sub-problem is to create a path passing by all these points. 
 This second sub-problem is similar than a classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP try to answer the questions asks by a travelling salesman "\textbf{What is the shortest path passing by each city only one time and return to the starting city?}".
  In the TSP, the cities are the nodes on the interconnected map and the roads are the connexions between them. The TSP is a well known as NP-hard and NP-complete in  some conditions as described in \citep{236*karp1972}. \\ 
Finally the solution used for the TSP can be applied for the second sub-problem of WRT.
 The TSP and the algorithms proposed to optimize it are discussed more in detail later in the Paragrapher \ref{par:TSPPathPlan}.

%a similar method than the one proposed by faigl in [235*] has been proposed to approximate the shorter path as possible. To approximate the shorter path the problem of WRP is also split in two sub-problem. The first sub-problem is considered as similar then the AGP and use the method form AGP to find the waypoints. The second sub-problem is also compared as TSP.

In faigl  \citep{235*faigl2010}  a similar method than the one proposed by Packer \citep{53*packer2008} has been proposed to approximate the shorter path as possible. The problem is also split into two sub-problems with the first is to optimize the position of the waypoints and the second is to schedule the position in order to create a path planning (directly inspired by the TSP). 
%the algorithm proposed is based on splitting the problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is to find a set of point with can be good enough to cover all the area despite a restricted visibility range. These points are called waypoints for the following sections. 
 Furthermore, the solution proposed by Faigl in \citep{235*faigl2010} is applicable to a watchman with a restricted visibility range. Equivalent then a $360^\circ$ field of view with a restricted depth of field. This restriction affects greatly the waypoints positioning. Thanks to this constraint more waypoints has to be place to cover an area.
 Once the set of waypoints to cover all the polygon is found, the second sub-problem is to create a path passing by all these waypoints.  The algorithms proposed  to do it, are also inspired by the solution given for the optimize the TSP.
 %This second sub-problem is similar then a classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP  try to answer the question ask by a travelling salesman "What is the shortest path passing by each city only one time and return to the starting city?". In the TSP, the city are the node on the interconnected map with the road as the connexion. The TSP is well known as NP-hard and NP-complete in some condition as described in [236*]. \\ 
%Finally the solution used for the TSP can be applied for the second sub-problem of WRT.
% The TSP and the algorithms proposed to optimize it are discussed more in detail later \ref{par:TSPPathPlan} \\
%In Packer [53*] similar solution than the one proposed by faigl in [235*] has been proposed to approximate the shorter path as possible. To approximate the shorter path the problem of WRP is also split in two sub-problem. The first sub-problem is considered as similar then the AGP and use the method form AGP to find the waypoints position. When the  waypoints are placed in the polygon the second sub-problem which is to schedule the waypoints to have a shorter path as possible.

\subsubsection{Limit and consequences}

The method proposed to solve the WRP are really interesting and give a good solution in some specific conditions. These conditions are also the restriction about the methods proposed. In fact the optimal solution, that mean the absolutely shortest path which cover all the area (polygon) are usable only if the polygon respect some rules.The polygon must be simple and take in count the guard ability (no viewing constraints).  \\
When the polygon begin to be more complex the optimal solution cannot be reached. The method applied to solve the WRP for complex area are interesting. Especially by the splitting the problem into sub-problems. Despite this interesting aspect the solution proposed are most of the time limited due to the area representation (must be a polygon composed by vertex). This representation associate to the geometric methodologies to find the waypoints give an crucial importance to the number of vertex in relation then the number of cameras. More the number of vertex is important more the first sub-problem risk to be difficult and long to solve. 
Consequently this method is not the more appropriate for the vast and complex outside area which would require  numerous vertex to describe it.
 The biggest limit of the WRP is the ability of the watchman. In fact in the original problem, the watchman is considered has perfect visibility. The solution proposed for answer to the WRP are not usable with the add of new visibility constraint. 
In Faigl \citep{235*faigl2010} the WRP begin to be extended by add a constraint on the visibility. In this condition the problem is slightly muted to self-organizing map in the way to became a coverage path planning. But despite the add of a restricted  depth of field  the solution based on geometric heuristic do not allow to add more constraints.

The AGP then WRP has greatly impacted the vision and the problem design of cameras coverage and coverage path planning.  Among the solutions discussed in the precedent section numerous articles are based and make references to the AGP and WRP. Our work is also inspired by its and will propose to extend it.

\subsection{CPP solutions}



To optimize the CPP problems many solutions were proposed. The different algorithms and methodologies proposed are discussed in the following sections. The methodologies proposed are  split in several branches. 
The more important branches to optimize the CPP is the use of sweep associate to a cellular decompositions.

\subsubsection{Cellular decomposition and sweep} \label{sec:CPPcellDecompSol}
\begin{mfigures}[!]{Illustration  of  simple cell decomposition with sweep.}{fig:CellDecp} \centering
\mfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{img/CellDecop.png}{}{}

\end{mfigures}	
To solve the CPP problem the solution the most common is to use the cellular decomposition. The cellular decomposition is by some aspect inspired by the methodologies presented from the WRP.
To remember one of the interesting solution for the WRP  is to split the problem in two sub-problems and optimize its independently. The first sub-problem is to find the best waypoints and the second sub-problem is to find the shorter path passing by all the waypoints (as a TSP).
 The Cellular decomposition also split the problem of CPP in two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is focus on the decomposition of the complex area in several cells. Each cell has to be a simple polygon (basically a rectangle or latter any quadrilateral polygon). Inside each cell a sweeping has be applied in order to cover all the area (see Figure \figref{fig:CellDecp}). The second sub-problem is to find the path which can connect each simple polygon. The problem has to take in account, the sweep start and end to find the global optimized shorter path. Where the global optimized shorter path take in account the sweep trajectory of each simple polygon and the path between the simple polygons.
 
 Finally the cellular decomposition is made by the decomposition of the complex area, choose the appropriate sweep and find the shorter path to connect the cells. 
 
 \paragraph*{Decomposition}\label{par:decomposition}

 The decomposition in cells, has to objective to split a complex area in several sub-area. The sub-area has to be simpler in term of shape in order to can applies a sweep. 
Since the 90s numerous algorithms has been developed for the cellular decomposition. Among the algorithms for cellular decomposition, 3 types of decomposition has been made. As it is explained in the survey of Choset  \cite{214*choset2001} and  Galceran and al \cite{66*galceran2013}. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Approximate: 
		An approximate decomposition is based on a discretization of the area. The free space of the area is representative by a set of cases (gird). Each case of the grid has to be cover by the mobile robot. A case is considered completely cover if the robot is on this position. That mean the frequency of the grid is defined by the covered area of the mobile robot. 
		The approximate decomposition by cases is fast to describe the area but is greatly limited due to the low sampling frequency of the gird and the limited trajectory possible.\\
	 
	\item Semi approximate: 
	 \begin{mfigures}[!]
{Illustration of a semi approximate decomposition issue of the survey  of Choset \citep{214*choset2001}. The 4 figures illustrate the trajectory of the robot in the time.}{fig:choset214SemiAprox} \centering
\mfigure{width=.95\linewidth}{img/Choset214SemiDecomp.png}{}{subfig:WRPi}
\hspace{1cm}
\end{mfigures}	
 The semi approximate decomposition is by part based on the discretization of the space. The idea is to create a set of large cells. The width of the cells is fix and the height is relative then the area boundary (see in \citep{214*choset2001}). 
	 The semi approximate cell decomposition allow to have cells with two parallel sides with a fix size (at the right and left) and  the  two other sides adapted to the boundary (at the up and down. See the illustration  of a semi approximation in Figure \figref{fig:choset214SemiAprox}).  The width  of  the cells are chosen depending then half of the focal length of the camera mounded on the mobile robot. The area is covered by following the boundary of the cells with sweep to pass cells  after cells.
	 The advantage of this semi approximate decomposition is the facility to describe a vast area and the low computation required. Additionally, this decomposition can be made on-line by the robot and do not require a hight level of knowledge of the area. 
	 The disadvantage is the non optimized path due to the cells decomposition. The simplicity  of this decomposition  can gender case, where the robot have to path many time by the same place. The semi approximate cellular decomposition do not allow to have a well optimised path planning. \\
	 
	 %%%%% add fig from238* fig8 to --> from214
	\item Exact cellular decomposition: 
	The exact cellular decomposition describe the area by create juxtaposed geometrical region. The size of the regions (or cells) are not dependent then the robot ability despite the previous decomposition. The large size of the cells allow the  mobile robot to do back and forth motion to cover all the cells (also called sweep as in Figure \figref{fig:sweepSpiral}).  The cells have to be ordered to have an efficient and short path passing by all the cells. 
The global path distance has to be reduced by an appropriate path passing by each cells	
	The exact cellular decomposition became popular and numerous algorithms has been proposed. The algorithms proposed  can be; a faster decomposition or with a more appropriate shape depending then the basic rectangle cells. 
	Among the numerous exact cellular decomposition the trapezoidal decomposition for this simplicity and historic importance, the Boustrophedon decomposition  and  Morse-based Cellular Decomposition for their importance in the construction of other exact cellular decomposition has to be cited. These algorithms and other has been clearly summarized in the survey of Carreras and Galceran \citep{66*galceran2013}. 
	The exact cellular decomposition has continue to be studied since the survey of  Carreras and Galceran  \citep{66*galceran2013} and upgraded, as in \cite{144*torres2016} for propose a decomposition for concave or multiple polygons.

 \paragraph*{Sweeps} \label{par:sweep}
	The back and forth or sweep is an essential element of the CPP by cellular decomposition. The sweep has to cover the entire cells. The cells are splitting the area in relatively simple polygons (as see in the paragraph \ref{par:decomposition} and  the Figure \figref{fig:CellDecp}). The sweep has to be adapted then the shape of the cells and also must start and finish in a appropriate position for passing to the next cells.
	For that the starting point and the ending point of the sweep are crucial for the global path planning.
	In Torres et al. \cite{144*torres2016}  the sweep is function then a direction and can go clockwise or counter-clockwise to have a start and end in the appropriate position for the transition. 
	 This allow to have 8 different applicable sweeps at each cell depending then the more appropriate start and finish  according to the computed path. The sweep are adapted depending then : 
	 \begin{itemize}
	 \item The turn sides ( clockwise or counter-clockwise)
	 \item The directions (horizontal or vertical)
	 \item The finishing  positions (start and stop form the same side or opposite side)
\end{itemize}	
	 The sweep can be also alternatively switch for a spiral as proposed in Jimenez et al. \citep{217*jimenez2007}. The proposed sweep and spiral in  \citep{217*jimenez2007}  are adaptable depending then the context. The sweep can have two directions and for the spiral two turn sides (clockwise or counter-clockwise).  The different sweeps and spirals are illustrated in the Figure \figref{fig:sweepSpiral}. 
	  \begin{mfigures}[!]{Different sweeps and spirals}{fig:sweepSpiral} \centering
\mfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{img/SweepSpiral.png}{}{}
\end{mfigures} 

	To have an adapted sweep the footprint has to be defined depending then the camera ability and the objectives. In \cite{144*torres2016} the size of the sweep is dependent then the area cover by a camera and a sufficient amount of overlaps for the 3D reconstruction (see also\citep{191*di2016}). In Li et al.  \citep{146*li2011} the foot print of the camera with a small pan is took in account. Due to the pan the camera projection is not a rectangle but a trapezoid. Consequently the sweep size is adapted by taking the larger side of the trapezoid for the sweep dimension.
	Also for the grid decomposition the sweep size is directly related the coverage ability of the mobile robots (as example in \citep{215*lee2010,195*choi2009}).  % also 216*+48  215*  195* +55 218*+12  use a sensing camera at the front).
	
	One extra element to take in account for the sweep can be in some case the external element as the wind. In \citep{215*lee2010,190*hsu2014}  %!![190*] !! 
	the external condition are taking in account in the cost function and influence the sweep.
	
	
	To summarize the sweeps has to be adapted then the area and the relation between cells. To choose the appropriate sweeps the following element has to be taking in account:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The size of sweep  have to be defined depending then the ability of the camera (foot print size).
		\item The direction (horizontal or vertical).
		\item The  starting and finishing  position (start and stop form the same side or opposite side)
	\end{itemize}
To  can have the more appropriate sweep is primordial to know by advance  the cells scheduling when is needed. The cells scheduling are a crucial part of the path planning.

	% The foot print, 
	 %the type of sweep ( sweep or spiral), the direction (horizontal or vertical), the finishing  position (start and stop form the same side or opposite side) the size of the footprint has to be defined depending then the ability of the camera.

 \paragraph*{Path planning} \label{par:TSPPathPlan}
 
The aims of the path planning is to find the short path passing by all the cells. Find the best path planning passing by all the waypoints or in this case all the cells is a complex problem  which can be formulated as a TSP. The path planning became even more tricky in the case of exact cellular decomposition. Or for any decomposition which requires a sweeping inside each cells. In fact in this case, the goal is to have the shorter path planning with taking in account each sweep and transition between cells. In the precedent Paragraph \ref{par:sweep} the different sweeps and spiral has been detailed. The start and the end of the sweep are the crucial elements to take in account  during the path planning computation.
 Obviously, to find the best scheduling between each cell the algorithm form the TSP are commonly used.     
 
 When the area is decomposed in cells the goal is to schedule the priority of passage from one cell to another in order to create an efficient path passing by all the cells. The scheduling of the cells can be optimize by using the paradigm of TSP with those algorithms to have the best path planning. 
The TSP is well known problem and is deeply studied form long time ago. First is essential  to remember the TSP is an NP-complete and NP-hard problem as proofed in Karp in \cite{236*karp1972}. 

To optimize the TSP numerous algorithms was tested and some of them has been specially applied to schedule the cells to have the shorter path. In  An et al. \cite{60*an2013} two algorithms was tested before to develop a third. The algorithms used are based on branch and bound. The algorithms developed in \cite{60*an2013} is called Novel Previous-Next Waypoints Coverage Constraint (PNWCC). The algorithms presented in \cite{60*an2013} propose at same time a schedule of each cells with also a smooth trajectory without sharp edges usable for non holonomic driving robots. 

	In the survey of Carreras et Galceran \citep{66*galceran2013} the solutions proposed to solve the TSP is to computes an exhaustive walk trough the adjacency graph. This solution is workable only for compute small adjacency graph. The GA is popular to optimize the TSP and is commonly use to evaluate the influence of this parameter as in \citep{68*muhlenbein1989} \citep{80*serpell2010}. About the CPP problem the GA is also used to optimize the TSP part as in Jimenez et al. \citep{217*jimenez2007}. Where the GA is applied to find an optimized schedule after an exact cellular decomposition of a complex polygon. \\
The GA is announced well appropriate to have an optimized solution for the TSP. 
In some situation a  TSP is not realistic and some external constraint can be added as the wind effect, the turbulences, or holonomy constraint as in \citep{56*davies2006,102*ware2016,66*galceran2013}). The add of external constraints may become more complex the scheduling  of the cells.

		\subsubsection{Other solution}
		
		Among the algorithms developed for the CPP some interesting methods have to be studied.		
		Some algorithms has been discussed in Choset \cite{214*choset2001} as approximate solution (see Section \ref{par:decomposition}). 
		
%	!!!	Despite this classification the decomposition of the area is not the really effective and the algorithms used must be highlight. Among it the solution based on regular grid discretization which this  comparatively to cellular decomposition high sampling frequency. As discussed earlier in this case the cell decomposition is made based on the coverage ability of the  mobile robots as  well detailed in \citep{218*meiting2007}.
%		Thanks to this relatively fine grid decomposition the number of case and the regularity of its the TSP paradigm is not the more appropriate and other solution may used to optimize the path planing of the mobile robots.
%		This solution is relatively popular for the plan the hoover robot path as in  \citep{216*luo2002,196*yang2004,215*lee2010,218*meiting2007}.
%		The idea is to have an algorithms which not tried to optimize globally the path planning but have an adapted local decision with maximize the global path plan. !!
		 The approximate cellular decomposition was briefly approached in the precedent Section \ref{par:decomposition}. The approximate cellular decomposition was considered as  not interesting due to the low sampling frequency of the grid. Conceptuality the works of \citep{216*luo2002,196*yang2004,215*lee2010} going further by using a higher sampling frequency of the area to cover. The  solution based on regular grid discretization which may be compared to  approximated cellular decomposition with a high sampling frequency as in \citep{218*meiting2007}.
		  Due to the relatively fine grid decomposition which engender an increased size of the case number, the algorithms to optimize the path  passing by all the cases of the grid has to be adapted . Consensually  new navigation strategy has been developed. 
		
		In Luo et al. \citep{216*luo2002} the goal is to have a complete coverage by visiting all the cases of a grid. To visit all the cases of the grid a neural-neighborhood analysis and neural dynamic programming approaches are adapted to have an efficient CPP for the robots. In Simon et Luo \citep{196*yang2004} they propose an similar method with a neural network solution for dynamic and non planar area.
		
		The work of Lee et al. \cite{215*lee2010} propose another solution based on smooth spiral path. The idea is to propose to follow the boundary of the room to fully cover and use a smoothed spiral to cover the area. The solution proposed is compared to other method. The main advantage of these method is the on-line ability and the smoothed trajectory(see also \citep{195*choi2009}).
		
		Before to conclude about some of the algorithms usable to optimise the coverage path planning the more elementary has to be discussed. In fact,  among the algorithms proposed until here the full random was not discussed. 
		In Liu et al. \cite{242*liu2008} a really basic methods is developed to cover an area with an mobile robot (hover robot) for on-line path planning in a dynamic environment. The algorithm proposed is based on random direction. The basic idea is to move forward until the detection of an obstacle (ultrasonic or bumper). When an obstacle is detected the robot turn randomly. This solution is really basic and is based on the idea then if the room is not too big or not specially complex with enough time the mobile robot will cover all. Obviously this solution is not optimized and not acceptable in many cases.

%\section{The origin}
Finally it is the end,  i hope that was easer  and faster to read it then for me to write it .

 from CPP : The conclusion is despite the low quality of the answer obtained with these methodologies the interesting track and possible gain must push the research to continue to explore the GAPSO optimization to solve the problem of coverage path planning problem as a one optimization problem. But caution the increased search space can become break of the optimization despite the reducing of the number of dimensions to optimize. In fact, the number of dimensions is reduced by fixing the altitude and the camera orientation and moreover with this  unique optimization  the number of required waypoints are greatly reduced. 
The main risk of using  a unique optimization for the problems of CPP is the complexity and the associate search space. In fact, among the reason to explain the inconclusive results, the complexity due to the fusion of 2 NP-hard and NP-complete problems could be the cause. \\
